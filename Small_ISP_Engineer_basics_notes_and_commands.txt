-------------------------------------------------OSPF-----------------------------------------------------------------

sh ip ospf border-routers --> shows ABR Router-id reachability with metric and next-hop.
sh ip ospf <process> <area> database summary <IP> self-originate --> The LSA that R1 floods to area mentioned.
sh ip ospf database summary <ip> adv-router <RID> --> shows the LSA that the router received from the adv-router RID.
sh ip ospf <interface command> --> shows almost all needed details: DR/BDR, cost, priority, whether it is ABR/ASBR etc.
OSPF Non-broadcast network to use for more security and when network doesn't support multicast. all packets will be unicast. neighbor is 
configured statically. 224.0.0.6. there will be a DR/BDR.
OSPF Point-to-multipoint is hub and spoke model. 224.0.0.5 can be used.
Ethernet interface defaults to broadcast.
Tunnel and Serial interface defaults to P2P.
DR election is not pre-emptive.
Loopbacks are sent as stub /32 networks.
OSPF external routes are not redistributed by default.
redistribute ospf 1 match internal external 2 metric <bw> <delay> <reliability> <load> <mtu> --> to restribute both inter and intra area routes.
sh ip ospf rib redistribution --> show the redistributed routes to OSPF.
debug ip routing --> shows prefix addition to rib.
sh ip ospf database self-originate | begin type-5
route-based tags are much better than prefix-based filtering cause they are dynamic enough for fast changing environments.
You can filter redistribute routes by: AD method (default), prefix filter using route maps, tag based using route maps.

By default these metrics used by various protocols when routes are redistributed. we call them default seed metric.
	RIP & EIGRP: infinty --> it means it won't advertise it further.
	OSPF: 20 and 1 when redistributing BGP routes.
	BGP: uses the IGP metric value.
	

------------------------------------------------BGP------------------------------------------------------------------------

sh bgp ipv4 unicast <ip> longer-prefix --> shows the subordinate suppressed routes and the aggregate address you'r advertising summar-only.
when you have multiple network commands inculding the sub-ordinate routes and a summary command with advertise summary only. only the summary route is adv.
origin code: ? for redistributed routes and i for network command routes.
default-information originate always <metric> --> it always advertise default route with the metric to it's peers irrespective of whether default route
in routing table or not.
by default external OSPF LSA are type 2.
one can originate default route with route-map. This will ensure that default route is only advertised when the routes in the route-map are present in RIB.
neighbor <RID> transport connection-mode active --> makes the BGP Peer TCP Client that will actively initiate the sessions.
RR can send the routes from RR clients to clients, non-clients, and EBGP peers.
RR doesn't change BGP Next-hop
RR appends two more fileds to avoid loop.
	originator ID: BGP RID of the device advertising/originating the IP from the RR perspective.
	Cluster-list: list of the RR's in the path. if RR originates the route then RR doesn't create cluster-list. removes cluster-list when sent to EBGP.
BGP local-as <AS number> no-prepend replace-as --> this will ensure that your real AS is not present in the BGP routes advertised with new local-as.

----------------------------------------------------URPF---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ward off spoofing attack.
An attacker can spoof source address and intiate icmp echo packets to a destination router. the destination router in turn send the unsolicited icmp reply
to the atcual network device with that source address leading to CPU utilisation and transit link wastage.
Router will check the source is reachable from the same link on which the packet is recieved. This is called Strict mode.
use loose mode when you think there might be asymmetrical routing. in this method Router will only check routing table, not the RIB + interface.
# ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx --> for strict mode
# ip verify unicast source reachable-via any --> for loose mode
you can log the drops using numbered acl with log with URPF. if you permit any IP in that acl, then that IP will be excluded from URPF check.
# ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx <numbered acl>.


------------------------------------------------------MPLS Transport and L3VPNS Multi-tenancy----------------------------------------------

MPLS header 32-bit header. label is 20-bit. Exp is 3 bit is mpls QOS 8 QOS class.S is 1 bit, it used to tell the position of mpls stack, set to 1
if it is the last header before the IP payload, all other set to 0. TTL is 8-bit, TTL copied from IP packet unless you block this.
LDP uses Link local mutlicast.
MPLS LDP runs on top of IGP. IGP is the decision maker for any path.
in LDP, the router advertising the route usually tells it peers what labels it uses for this prefix and the peer should use this lable while sending the
packets on mpls network.
LSP's are uni-directional.
you can create label range using this command: mpls lable range <left limit> <right limit>.
LDP uses both TCP & UDP
	LDP UDP: hellos to 224.0.0.2 (this is all routers link local mutlicast group).neighbors keep track of hello packets even when tcp sess not establis.
	LDP TCP: Session between RIDs.
show mpls interfaces --> shows on interfaces mpls is enabled.
show mpls ldp discovery --> for mpls discovery stats.
show mpls ldp neighbor --> to verify the neighbors are up
debug mpls ldp transport events --> to debug mpls ldp evebts
LDP binds lables non-BGP routes by default.
show mpls ldp bindings <ip subnet> --> shows label bindings
show mpls forwarding-table labels --> shows LFIB
BGP VPN route is 96 bit:32-bit ip address plus 64-bit RD value.
BGP update message has this VPN route + RT values + next-hop + VPN label
Bottom lable is VPN label, top label is LDP transport label.
VPN ID: keeps the BGP routes unique as this prepended to the IP routes.
RT ensures to import those routes to VRF routing table.
when routes are copied from the VRF table to the BGP routing tables, Export-tag is applied.
mpls labesl in/out : in means local VPN label & out means remote VPN label.
VRF-LITE Hairpin Security routing: this is to hairpin the traffic to pass it via some security device --> Very IMP.

----------------------------------------------------------IP SLA--------------------------------------------------------

4 main capabilities.
	Test Reachability.
	Troubleshoot Network paths. path validation using path echo & path jitter.
	Validate services: act as DNS, HTTP or FTP client.
	measure performance: jitter, RTT, packet loss, one way latency, or voice performance. this is handled by udp jitter operation.
IP SLA timeout:- how long until probe/router keep running until the probe/router gives up and mark it fail.
Successful probes are compared with their threshold. indicates soft-failure.
sh ip sla stasistics.
sh ip sla transponder
inside track you can give delay up --> it means it will wait till that time before making the ip sla state up.
show track <number> --> it will shows the state of ipsla that is being tracked.
sh ip sla summary

-----------------------------------------------------------Radius Vs TACACS+--------------------------------------
Radius is usually used for securing remote access to networks and network services against unauthorised access.
TACACS+ is usually used for adminstartor access to network devices.
Radius: standards-based. TACACS+: cisco propreitary
Radius: udp 1812 (auth & authorisation combined in radius) and 1813 (accounting). Tacacs+ uses TCP port 49.
Raidus: Encrypts only password. TACACS+: encrypts everything.
TACACS+ provide flexble command authorisation.
Netflow uses UDP port 2055
